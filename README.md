# My_Cloud_Game
Group Project with Alexandra Tatum, Amber Wagoner, Kat Keas

To start the game, you must run the code on your local machine in your preferred editor.

With the My_Cloud_Game open in your terminal, execute the command: ```node server.js```
This will open the server locally on your machine and show a link to open in your browser.
    ```Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/```
